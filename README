Simple lambda with multi module common backend for a few different lambda functions. Seems to nice idea for JVM applications,
however compilation of an application to a native binary is quite slow, but acceptable on a modern hardware.
Dirty version for early R&d, but might be useful in the future. Crated with JDK 11 and Graal 20 CE.

To run native:
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -P native
$ sam deploy -g -t sam.native.yml

To run JVM:
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
$ sam deploy -g -t sam.jvm.yml
